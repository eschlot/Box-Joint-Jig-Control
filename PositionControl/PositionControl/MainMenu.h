*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *
*  --------------------------                                          *
*                                                                      *
*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    
*                                                                      *
*  Under all circumstances the software shall only be operated under   *
*  the conditions described in the SAFETY documentation.               *
*  The software is only allowed to be operated in a surrounding where  *
*  the safety of the overall system is ensured by the design and the   *
*  construction of the jig to which the electronic hardware including  *
*  the stepper motor and the software are mounted.                     * 
*                                                                      *
*  This software is developed to be used in a jig for a table saw only *
*  where the jig itself is designed in such a way that it cannot harm  *
*  a user under any circumstance.                                      *
*  This means that the design, the construction and the usage of the   *
*  table saw jig has to be done is such a way that even in case the    *
*  stepper motor of the jig is operated in any direction in a middle   *
*  of a cut neither the jig itself or a workpiece in the jig can harm  *
*  a user.                                                             *
*  These extra safety regulations need to be taken over to any         *
*  derived work out of this work.                                      *
*                                                                      *
