#SAFETY Instructions

You are only permitted to use this software if You fully follow the following safety instructions:

**Note:** Neither the arduino Due board nor the software distributed here can fullfill any safety requirment. The hardware does not have a redundant calculation capability and the touch display is not designed for safety critical input. It simply does not have a redundant input path.

**Hence:**  
_This software is developed to be used in a jig for a table saw only where the jig itself is designed in such a way that it cannot harm a user under any circumstance._
**This means that the design, the construction and the usage of the table saw jig has to be done is such a way that even in case the stepper motor of the jig is operated in any direction in a middle of a cut neither the jig itself or a workpiece in the jig can harm a user. **
