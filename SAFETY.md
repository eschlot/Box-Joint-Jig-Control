#SAFETY Instructions

You are only permitted to use this software if You fully follow the following safety instructions:

**Note:** Neither the arduino Due board nor the software distributed here can fullfill any safety requirement. The hardware does not have a redundant calculation capability and the touch display is not designed for safety critical input. It simply does not have a redundant input path.

**Hence:**  
_This software is developed to be used in a jig for a table saw only where the jig itself is designed in such a way that it cannot harm a user under any circumstance._

**This means that the design, the construction and the usage of the table saw jig has to be done is such a way that even in case the stepper motor of the jig is operated in any direction in a middle of a cut neither the jig itself or a workpiece in the jig can harm a user.**

#Minimum measures to achieve functional safety:

- Wear safety cloth including eyewear, ear protection, foot protection and no loose cloth that might get into any machine. Do not wear gloves on a machine with rotating parts.
- Use clamps and holddowns to fix the workpiece in the jig. Ensure these are strong enough to protect workpieces from beeing lift up by the rising sawblade tooth at the back of the saw blade.
- Never, under no circumstance, hold a workpiece by your hands. Any workpiece has to be fixed to the jig. 
- Use a hold down mechanism to ensure the jig cannot get away from the table saw. Especially note that the jig shall be protected from being lifted up from the table saw desk. Mind This that at the back pf the saw blade the tooth are rising and can easily lift up the workpiece together with the jig if there is no protection against this. This is especially a risk if there is an unintended operation of the stepper motor of the jig when a workpiece is just cut. A suitable holddown can be done by T-Nuts in a table saw miter slot (if this can take T-Nuts) or by a comlete fence system mounted to the tabel saw desk ensuring that the jig cannot be moved up unintentionally. 
- The jig needs to be designed in such a way that the sawblade can only cut at the forseen cutting area. Ensure that there are stops mounted at the table saw desk in such a way that the saw blade cannot stick out of the jig at the side of the jig the operator is standing and working with the jig.
- Use a dust collection mechanism.
- Stay back when doing the cuts into the workpiece. You can look at the result later, when the table saw stands still. 
- Operate the jig by grabbing it far away from the saw blade. Keep a distance between your hand and the saw blade bigger than 20 centimeter, always. Do not grab in a line with the saw blade. 
- Do not take drugs or alcohol when operating any machine. 
- Follow all safety regulations that came ewith Your table saw.
